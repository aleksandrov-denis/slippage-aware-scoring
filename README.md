# Objective
Solves the modified version of the global pairwise alignment scoring problem where the algorithm accounts for nucleotide insertions and deletions caused by DNA polymerase slippage.

# Responsibilities
Responsible for implementing an algorithm that runs in O(mn), where m and n are the lengths of the sequences being compared. Modified the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for this objective.

# Output
Outputs the optimal score and alignment of the specified DNA sequence pairs given in each text file.

# To Run
Run ```python align.py sequence0.txt [sequence1.txt ...]```. Note that you can replace the contents of the two text files or add new ones, the given files are to illustrate the functionality of the algorithm.
